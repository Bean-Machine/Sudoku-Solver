A GUI-based sudoku solver written in **Python (Tkinter).**

##  About

This project was one of many little projects I wrote while teaching myself Python from scratch.  

Code 100% my own, based an algorithm which I deduced from someone else's sudoku solver video on YouTube.

Watching his solver in motion (also GUI-based), I could immediately tell what it was doing and then went about reverse engineering the same algorithm in code.

No AI was used.

## How to Use

- **Arrow keys** â€” Move the cell selector around the grid
- **Number keys 1-9** â€” Enter the digit directly into the selected cell
- **0 key** â€” Delete the selected cell's value
- **Backspace key** â€” Delete the selected cell's value
- **Left mouse button** â€” Select the cell clicked on
- **'Solve' button on the GUI** â€” Solve the puzzle, showing each step in the GUI
- **'Quick Solve' button on the GUI** â€” Solve the puzzle without showing the process. Much quicker than 'Solve'
- **'Reset' button on the GUI** â€” Stop solving the puzzle, leave the user-entered values in place
- **'Clear' button on the GUI** â€” Stop solving + clear the entire grid
